- ⚡ Fun fact: ... General fact: Before Cannabis was classified as a schedule I narcotic, the male hemp plant was used to make paper. This is why pages in some older books yellow. Personal fact: For a little over a year or so I lived off of a morning protien shake, no lunch and then a dinner of 6 eggs cooked however I chose to cook them (scrambled, fried in bacon grease, omelete, basic stuff). Desert consisted of any pastry, cookie, snack cake, icecream or any combination thereof. Possibly the healthiest I've been.
